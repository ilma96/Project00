<p>Fast Food Ordering App (Beginner Level) using MS SQL Server through Docker and designing database using Dbeaver.</p>
<ul>
<li> In the beginning, four options are given before the user. The user can view the <b>food</b> menu (The menu is a table designed on Dbeaver connected to the MS SQL Server from port 1433)
or go to <b>advanced options</b> or choose to quit. There is another option that is <b>administrator options</b>, which requires login. That option allows a Menu
Administrator to update a row on the Menu table. That option is not meant for the Customer. Hence, the added layer of security. </li>
</ul>
